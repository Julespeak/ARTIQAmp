Specs of the Zotino (https://github.com/sinara-hw/Zotino/wiki):
>Output impedance of DAC is 500ohm with 2.2nF in parallel
>Output amplifier: OPA197
>All together, the output of the DACs has a 3rd-order Butterworth response with 75kHz cutoff frequency


Options for amplifier:
>OPA454 [296-41370-1-ND] //highest voltage
>OPA542 [296-15965-1-ND]
>OPA445 [OPA445AU-ND] //the one from the old LL design

>D-Sub connector:
>>5787082-7 [A31814-ND]


General thoughts:
>Would it be possible to use a boost converter and drive the amps directly from the output of the Zotino?
>>Could check out the schematics for the Zotino to see how this is done without getting too much noise

General notes about using KiCAD:
>Select a component and go to properties; from here you can edit the library reference to change the library that the symbol derives from
>http://docs.kicad-pcb.org/5.1.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html


Still ToDo:
>[CRITICAL] Figure out if it's possible to have hierarchical layouts similar to the schematics
>Figure out the best default connection for the unused pins of the OPA454
>Make sure that relative libraries work on different comptuers
